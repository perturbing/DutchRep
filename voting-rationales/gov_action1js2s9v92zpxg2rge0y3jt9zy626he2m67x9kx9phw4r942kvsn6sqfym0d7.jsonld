    "comment": "We, the Dutch DRep, vote “No” on this proposal to reduce the Cardano treasury cut from 20% to 10%. We would like to thank Andrew Westberg for his effort and for initiating this important discussion. Our reasons for voting “No” are as follows:\n\n1. While the proposal aims to improve economic incentives, the evidence presented is not sufficiently conclusive to demonstrate its long-term impact. The rationale appears somewhat one-sided and lacks robust data to support such a significant change.\n\n2. We also disagree with the method by which this proposal was put forth, moving straight to an on-chain governance action without a more thorough off-chain review. We believe major economic parameter changes should follow a careful, well-structured, and transparent deliberation process.\n\n3. A recent video titled “Cardano: NerdOut – Let’s Have a TEA Party” frames a ‘No’ vote as an endorsement of the current 20% tax. We do not share that perspective. Our ‘No’ vote pertains strictly to this immediate request to lower the parameter to 10%. We believe a more comprehensive analysis and community-driven consensus should guide any revision of the treasury cut.\n\nFor these reasons, we cast our vote as “No” and invite further evidence-based discussion and inclusive engagement to reach a sustainable decision on treasury parameters."
